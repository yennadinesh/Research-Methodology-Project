I developed an application that can classify the input image into tomato, potato ,rice and pepper diseases along with their remedies. The model is developed by implementing the CNN and the Tensor Flow   model thus generated is converted to Tensor Flow Lite, which makes the model compatible with the mobile applications.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89174238/130002388-b1c25f61-f276-46e1-984b-9e285a00e7c8.png)
